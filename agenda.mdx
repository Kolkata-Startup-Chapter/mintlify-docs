title: "Agenda for Today’s Meetup"
---

### Context

The first Lenny’s meetup in Kolkata was a big success, with 18 people from Product, Growth, and AI coming together. The group has organically decided to form a community focused on sharing knowledge around AI, Product, and Growth, and encouraging startups to be built from Kolkata.

---

### 1. Defining the Community Motto & Focus

- Align on the core purpose of the community
- Focus on **three key pillars**:
  - **Startups**
  - **Product**
  - **GTM (Growth & Go-To-Market)**
- Tech will always be part of what we do, but it should **enable** outcomes, not be the end goal
- Position the community as **tech-enabled, not tech-for-tech’s-sake**
- Ensure we attract builders working on **tech-enabled products**, without making tech a barrier to entry

---

### 2. Enriching Community Resources

Discuss how we build long-term value for members through shared resources:

**Key resource initiatives:**

1. A community website with:
   - Clear and sharp messaging
   - Community vision, values, and activities
2. Insightful blogs focused on:
   - Product thinking
   - Growth strategies
   - Startup learnings
3. Short, practical video tutorials
4. A strong and consistent social media presence
5. Lightweight tools for:
   - Growth
   - Product
   - Marketing\
     (Engineering-first GTM approach)

---

### 3. Internal Job Portal

- Build a curated job engine focused on quality over quantity
- Manually review every job post and, where possible, validate with the hiring company
- Actively prevent spam or low-quality listings
- Create a parallel open portal for job seekers to access opportunities
- Use this as a **silent GTM channel** to grow and strengthen the community

---

### 4. Building the Product, Growth, AI & Startup Ecosystem

- Curate a list of people in and around Kolkata who are:
  - Building tech-first startups
  - Working in global Product, Growth, and AI roles
- Invite them for:
  - Webinars
  - Meetups
  - Fireside chats
- Use these interactions as a **trust-building layer** for the community

---

### 5. Hackathons & Pitchathons

- Organize:
  - Online hackathons and pitchathons regularly
  - 1–2 offline events annually
- Focus on real problem-solving and startup outcomes, not just demos

---

### 6. Growth Channels
